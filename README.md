# Reactjs boilerplate

Minimal boilerplate to get started with reactjs-typescript. This repo is pre-configured with eslint, prettier, lint-staged, husky, and react-router-dom.

## Motivation

When starting to create a new project with reactjs, we are presented with a default template which still requires a lot of configuration to actually start building the project. So as not to configure every time you create a new project. I made a simple boilerplate that is ready to use to create the actual project. at least ðŸ¥¹.

## Get started

All you need is to clone this repository to your local computer and install all dependencies and all done ðŸ˜Ž, instead of using the default template from reactjs, but you choose..

**All Steps:**

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/ahmadnzr/reactjs-boilerplate.git'
cd reactjs-boilerplate
yarn
```
